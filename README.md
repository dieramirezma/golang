# Golang Learning Repository

This repository contains my personal journey learning the Go programming language (Golang). It serves as both a reference and a showcase of my progress in mastering Go concepts, patterns, and building applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

- **basics/**: Core language concepts and fundamentals
- **exercises/**: Practice problems and coding challenges
- **projects/**: Complete applications and more complex implementations

## Directory Purpose

### basics/
This directory contains examples and notes on fundamental Go concepts such as:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and methods
- Structs and interfaces
- Concurrency (goroutines and channels)
- Error handling

### exercises/
Practice problems and coding challenges to reinforce learning, including:
- Algorithm implementations
- Data structure exercises
- Problem-solving tasks
- Small coding challenges

### projects/
Full-fledged applications and more complex implementations showcasing:
- Web applications/APIs
- CLI tools
- Integration with databases
- Third-party library usage
- Production-ready patterns

## Setup Instructions

### Installing Go

1. Download Go from [golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
3. Verify installation with `go version` in your terminal

### Setting up your workspace

```bash
# Check your Go environment
go env

# Initialize a new module
go mod init example.com/myproject

# Install dependencies
go get example.com/some-dependency
```

### Running Go programs

```bash
# Run a Go file directly
go run main.go

# Build an executable
go build main.go

# Run tests
go test ./...
```
